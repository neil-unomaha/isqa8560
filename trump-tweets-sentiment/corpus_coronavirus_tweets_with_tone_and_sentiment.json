{"text": " China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! We are in very close communication with China concerning the virus. Very few cases reported in USA, but strongly on watch. We have offered China and President Xi any help that is necessary. Our experts are extraordinary! Just received a briefing on the Coronavirus in China from all of our GREAT agencies, who are also working closely with China. We will continue to monitor the ongoing developments. We have the best experts anywhere in the world, and they are on top of it 24/7! https://t.co/rrtF1Stk78 Working closely with China and others on Coronavirus outbreak. Only 5 people in U.S., all in good recovery. Just had a long and very good conversation by phone with President Xi of China. He is strong, sharp and powerfully focused on leading the counterattack on the Coronavirus. He feels they are doing very well, even building hospitals in a matter of only days. Nothing is easy, but... ....he will be successful, especially as the weather starts to warm &amp; the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone. Great discipline is taking place in China, as President Xi strongly leads what will be a very successful operation. We are working closely with China to help! The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC &amp; World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me! Cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer is complaining, for publicity purposes only, that I should be asking for more money than $2.5 Billion to prepare for Coronavirus. If I asked for more he would say it is too much. He didn\u2019t like my early travel closings. I was right. He is incompetent! CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus, including the very early closing of our borders to certain areas of the world. It was opposed by the Dems, \u201ctoo soon\u201d, but turned out to be the correct decision. No matter how well we do, however, the..... ....Democrats talking point is that we are doing badly. If the virus disappeared tomorrow, they would say we did a really poor, and even incompetent, job. Not fair, but it is what it is. So far, by the way, we have not had one death. Let\u2019s keep it that way! Just landed. India was great, trip very successful. Heading to the White House. Meetings and calls scheduled today. @CDCgov, @SecAzar and all doing a great job with respect to Coronavirus! Briefing this afternoon. Low Ratings Fake News MSDNC (Comcast) &amp; @CNN are doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible. Likewise their incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades are all talk, no action. USA in great shape! @CDCgov..... \u201cAnti-Trump Network @CNN doing whatever it can to stoke a national Coronavirus panic. The far left Network pretty much ignoring anyone who they interview who doesn\u2019t blame President Trump.\u201d @trish_regan @FoxNews Media refuses to discuss the great job our professionals are doing! Do Nothing Democrats were busy wasting their time on the Impeachment Hoax, &amp; anything they could do to make the Republican Party look bad, while I was busy calling early boarder &amp; flight closings, putting us way ahead in our battle with the Coronavirus. Dems called it very wrong! Congratulations and thank you to our great Vice President &amp; all of the many professionals doing such a fine job at CDC &amp; all other agencies on the Coronavirus situation. Only a very small number in U.S., &amp; China numbers look to be going down. All countries working well together! \u201cDiagnosis positive: @CNN is infected with Trump Derangement Syndrome. I\u2019m calling out CNN for irresponsibly politicizing what should be a unifying battle against a virus that doesn\u2019t choose sides.\u201d @trish_regan @FoxNews  Like I say, they are Fake News! So, the Coronavirus, which started in China and spread to various countries throughout the world, but very slowly in the U.S. because President Trump closed our border, and ended flights, VERY EARLY, is now being blamed, by the Do Nothing Democrats, to be the fault of \u201cTrump\u201d. The Do Nothing Democrats were busy wasting time on the Immigration Hoax, &amp; anything else they could do to make the Republican Party look bad, while I was busy calling early BORDER &amp; FLIGHT closings, putting us way ahead in our battle with Coronavirus. Dems called it VERY wrong! I will be having a 1:30 P.M. Press Conference at the White House to discuss the latest CoronaVirus developments. Thank you! Coronavirus: In addition to screening travelers \u201cprior to boarding\u201d from certain designated high risk countries, or areas within those countries, they will also be screened when they arrive in America. Thank you! @VP @SecAzar @CDCgov @CDCDirector A Poll in today\u2019s New York Post says that 77% of \u201cU.S. adults have confidence in their government\u2019s ability to handle the Coronavirus (Number One), compared to other health threats.\u201d 64% for Zika, 58% for Ebola. Others way down on list. Our professionals are doing a great job! I am meeting with the major pharmaceutical companies today at the White House about progress on a vaccine and cure. Progress being made! I was criticized by the Democrats when I closed the Country down to China many weeks ahead of what almost everyone recommended. Saved many lives. Dems were working the Impeachment Hoax. They didn\u2019t have a clue! Now they are fear mongering. Be calm &amp; vigilant! Australia\u2019s Central Bank cut interest rates and stated it will most likely further ease in order to make up for China\u2019s Coronavirus situation and slowdown. They reduced to 0.5%, a record low. Other countries are doing the same thing, if not more so. Our Federal Reserve has us.... Australia\u2019s Central Bank cut interest rates and stated it will most likely further ease in order to make up for China\u2019s Coronavirus situation and slowdown. They reduced to 0.5%, a record low. Other countries are doing the same thing, if not more so. Our Federal Reserve has us.... Congress has agreed to provide $8 Billion to fight Coronavirus! This means @CDC, @HHSGov, and @DHSgov will have the resources they need to Keep America Safe and keep the risk to workers and families very low. This is great news for our Health, our Economy, and our Nation! Congress has agreed to provide $8 Billion to fight Coronavirus! This means @CDCgov, @HHSGov, and @DHSgov will have the resources they need to Keep America Safe and keep the risk to workers and families very low. This is great news for our Health, our Economy, and our Nation! I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work. This is just more Fake News and disinformation put out by the Democrats, in particular MSDNC. Comcast covers the CoronaVirus situation horribly, only looking to do harm to the incredible &amp; successful effort being made! With approximately 100,000 CoronaVirus cases worldwide, and 3,280 deaths, the United States, because of quick action on closing our borders, has, as of now, only 129 cases (40 Americans brought in) and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible! Gallup just gave us the highest rating ever for the way we are handling the CoronaVirus situation. The April 2009-10 Swine Flu, where nearly 13,000 people died in the U.S., was poorly handled. Ask MSDNC &amp; lightweight Washington failure @RonaldKlain, who the President was then? It is FAKE NEWS that @HHSGov @SecAzar is \u201csidelined\u201d from the great job he is doing on the CoronaVirus Task Force. He has the total confidence of the @VP and myself, and is doing a fantastic job, as the numbers would indicate! Spoke to Governor @GavinNewsom early this morning about the cruise ship quarantined off the California Coast. CoronaVirus test kits have been delivered, testing is taking place now. https://t.co/Pqda00HVCC We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus. We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas, which was a Godsend. V.P. is doing a great job. The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad! The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, \u201cThe risk is low to the average American.\u201d Great job being done by the @VP and the CoronaVirus Task Force. Thank you! So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that! Our CoronaVirus Team has been doing a great job. Even Democrat governors have been VERY complimentary! Vanity Fair Magazine, which will soon be out of business, and their third rate Fake reporters, who make up sources which don\u2019t exist, wrote yet another phony &amp; boring hit piece. The facts are just the opposite. Our team is doing a great job with CoronaVirus! Someone needs to tell the Democrats in Congress that CoronaVirus doesn\u2019t care what party you are in. We need to protect ALL Americans! ....Together we are putting into policy a plan to prevent, detect, treat and create a vaccine against CoronaVirus to save lives in America and the world. America will get it done! I want to thank all of our Great Government officials on the CoronaVirus Task Force who are working around the clock, in response to the CoronaVirus. Continue to check https://t.co/boZM2NePJW for updates, and follow all recommendations that are available.... I am fully prepared to use the full power of the Federal Government to deal with our current challenge of the CoronaVirus! The Media should view this as a time of unity and strength. We have a common enemy, actually, an enemy of the World, the CoronaVirus. We must beat it as quickly and safely as possible. There is nothing more important to me than the life &amp; safety of the United States! 108 countries are dealing with the CoronaVirus problem, some of which we are helping! For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied,  its testing system, but did nothing about it. It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further..... .... Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go! To this point, and because we have had a very strong border policy, we have had 40 deaths related to CoronaVirus. If we had weak or open borders, that number would be many times higher! I will be having a news conference today at 3:00 P.M., The White House. Topic: CoronaVirus! I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening. This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests, and paid sick leave for our impacted American workers. I have directed.... Good teamwork between Republicans &amp; Democrats as the House passes the big CoronaVirus Relief Bill. People really pulled together. Nice to see! Attending meetings on Covid-19 in the White House. Working with States and local governments, many of whom have done a great job. Full report latter! Just finished a meeting on Covid-19 in the Situation Room, news conference coming up shortly. https://t.co/JaNDpyMWjL https://t.co/x9lSEXjnea COVID-19 UPDATE https://t.co/xzSHlNiS9K Just had a nice conversation with Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau of Canada. Great to hear that his wonderful wife Sophie is doing very well. The United States and Canada will continue to coordinate closely together on COVID-19. There will be a News Conference by the CoronaVirus Task Force today at the White House, 5 P.M. @VP  We are working closely with the Governors of our Country\u2019s great States, which are a very big factor. They are working hard, along with us, to get the job properly done..... ....The USA was never set up for this, just look at the catastrophe of the H1N1 Swine Flu (Biden in charge, 17,000 people lost, very late response time), but it soon will be. Great decision to close our China, and other, borders early. Saved many lives! The individual Governors of States, and local officials, must step up their efforts on drive up testing and testing sights, working in conjunction with @CDCgov and the Federal Government! The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before! Cuomo wants \u201call states to be treated the same.\u201d But all states aren\u2019t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all. New York is a very big \u201chotspot\u201d, West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases. Andrew, keep politics out of it.... Federal Government is working very well with the Governors and State officials. Good things will happen! #KILLTHEVIRUS For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you. The onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault! Will be stronger than ever! I will be having a news conference today to discuss very important news from the FDA concerning the Chinese Virus! I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the \u201cborders\u201d from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful &amp; false! I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need, but we are all in this TOGETHER! THANK YOU to our Police Officers, Fire Fighters, and EMS who help us defeat the Virus every day. Our proud nation is grateful for the unwavering dedication and sacrifice of our First Responders and their families. TOGETHER we will beat this! America\u2019s Private Sector is stepping up to help us be STRONG! Many of the Nation\u2019s distillers, large and small, are producing and donating hand sanitizer to help fight #COVID19. THANK YOU! https://t.co/bcjKA9Janw CHINESE VIRUS FACT CHECK https://t.co/qJugCylvE2 Ford, General Motors and Tesla are being given the go ahead to make ventilators and other metal products, FAST! @fema  Go for it auto execs, lets see how good you are? @RepMarkMeadows @GOPLeader @senatemajldr My friend (always there when I\u2019ve needed him!), Senator @RandPaul, was just tested \u201cpositive\u201d from the Chinese Virus. That is not good! He is strong and will get better. Just spoke to him and he was in good spirits. A great early result from a drug that will start tomorrow in New York and other places! #COVID\u30fc19 https://t.co/4F4Qk4WFtK It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world. They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus.... ....us since the beginning of this crisis.\u201d They meant the opposite? Forgot to mention that I closed our Country to China (and Europe) very early, long before it was considered acceptable to do so. Sleepy Joe said I was \u201cxenophobic\u201d, but I saved thousands of lives! Fake News! Republicans had a deal until Nancy Pelosi rode into town from her extended vacation. The Democrats want the Virus to win? They are asking for things that have nothing to do with our great workers or companies. They want Open Borders &amp; Green New Deal. Republicans shouldn\u2019t agree! The Hill/HarrisX: 61% to 39% Approval Rating on handling of Coronavirus situation. Thank you! The World market for face masks and ventilators is Crazy. We are helping the states to get equipment, but it is not easy. Just got 400 Ventilators for @NYCMayor Bill de Blasio. Work beginning on 4 hospitals in New York! Millions of different type items coming! I am working very hard to help New York City &amp; State. Dealing with both Mayor &amp; Governor and producing tremendously for them, including four new medical centers and four new hospitals. Fake News that I won\u2019t help them because I don\u2019t like Cuomo (I do). Just sent 4000 ventilators! Just reported that the United States has done far more \u201ctesting\u201d than any other nation, by far! In fact, over an eight day span, the United States now does more testing than what South Korea (which has been a very successful tester) does over an eight week span. Great job! The four hospitals that we (FEMA) are building in NYC at the Javits Convention Center are moving along very well, ahead of schedule. Many additional ventilators also delivered. Good conversation with Governor Cuomo! Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China. Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet. China has been through much &amp; has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect! ...&amp; costly. Workers &amp; small businesses need money now in order to survive. Virus wasn\u2019t their fault. It is \u201cHELL\u201d dealing with the Dems, had to give up some stupid things in order to get the \u201cbig picture\u201d done. 90% GREAT! WIN BACK HOUSE, but throw Massie out of Republican Party! As usual with \u201cthis\u201d General Motors, things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, \u201cvery quickly\u201d. Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke \u201cP\u201d. General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!  FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!  @GeneralMotors  @Ford We have just purchased many Ventilators from some wonderful companies. Names and numbers will be announced later today! Thousand of Federal Government (delivered) Ventilators found in New York storage. N.Y. must distribute NOW! We are marshalling the full power of government and society to achieve victory over the virus. Together, we will endure, we will prevail, and we will WIN! #CARESAct https://t.co/zb2PJTldGQ I love Michigan, one of the reasons we are doing such a GREAT job for them during this horrible Pandemic. Yet your Governor, Gretchen \u201cHalf\u201d Whitmer is way in over her head, she doesn\u2019t have a clue. Likes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude! #MAGA On the recommendation of the White House CoronaVirus Task Force, and upon consultation with the Governor\u2019s of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, I have asked the @CDCgov to issue a strong Travel Advisory, to be administered by the Governors, in consultation with the.... \u201cWith the Tax Cuts and new Trade Deals, we were set for a tremendous growth rate this year.... and then the Virus came along.\u201d @larry_kudlow  @MariaBartiromo We were breaking all records, especially on employment. It will all come roaring back again, and fast! Polls are showing tremendous disapproval of Lamestream Media coverage of the Virus crisis. The Fake News just hasn\u2019t figured that out yet! So proud of the @USACEHQ, @FEMA, and the Federal Government for the 2,900 bed hospital they built in 4 days (way ahead of schedule) in the Javits Center for NY. We are now moving the teams to join others so they can continue to build more hospitals/beds. Keep up the GREAT WORK! Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats delayed the Workers Help/Stimulus Bill by over a week, trying to add real \u201cjunk\u201d into the Bill. Got some bad things, having nothing to do with those affected by the Virus, included. Republicans need their votes until we WIN BACK THE HOUSE IN 2020! 30 DAYS TO SLOW THE SPREAD\n#COVID\u30fc19 https://t.co/p9j7kZsD7b https://t.co/RSUHRfT8If Somebody please explain to Cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer that we do have a military man in charge of distributing goods, a very talented Admiral, in fact. New York has gotten far more than any other State, including hospitals &amp; a hospital ship, but no matter what, always complaining..... Massive amounts of medical supplies, even hospitals and medical centers, are being delivered directly to states and hospitals by the Federal Government. Some have insatiable appetites &amp; are never satisfied (politics?). Remember, we are a backup for them. The complainers should... ....have been stocked up and ready long before this crisis hit. Other states are thrilled with the job we have done. Sending many Ventilators today, with thousands being built. 51 large cargo planes coming in with medical supplies. Prefer sending directly to hospitals. America owes our very hard working food supply workers so much as they produce and deliver high quality food for us during this horrible COVID-19. Join me in thanking our Farmers, Ranchers, Processors, Distributors and Stores! @JohnBoozman I will be having a White House CoronaVirus Task Force meeting in a short while. May or may not do a News Conference after the meeting, depending on new information. Talks &amp; meetings today are proving promising, but a rough two weeks are coming up! For humanitarian reasons, the passengers from the two CoronaVirus stricken cruise ships have been given medical treatment and, when appropriate, allowed to disembark, under strict supervision. Very carefully done. People we\u2019re dying &amp; no other countries would allow them to dock! Advertising in the Failing New York Times is WAY down. Washington Post is not much better. I can\u2019t say whether this is because they are Fake News sources of information, to a level that few can understand, or the Virus is just plain beating them up. Fake News is bad for America! The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation? \u201cThe number of New Yorkers admitted to hospitals has dropped.\u201d @ainsleyearhardt @foxandfriends  Good news! Will be immediately sending 100 Ventilators to Colorado at the request of Senator Gardner! https://t.co/Nj4EPxfZl6 .@OANN  A key CoronaVirus Model is now predicting far fewer deaths than the number shown in earlier models. That\u2019s because the American people are doing a great job. Social Distancing etc. Keep going! \u201cI think the situation is unprecedented, and there is no question about that. It\u2019s whiplash! The economy was moving forward at a rapid pace in terms of growth, jobs and even wage increases, and all of a sudden the pandemic hit and the.... So now the Fake News @nytimes is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe, NOT China. This is a first! I wonder where the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs, and obviously want back in. Sad! So now the Fake News @nytimes is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe, NOT China. This is a first! I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs, and obviously want back in. Sad! A very good sign is that empty hospital beds are becoming more and more prevalent. We deployed 418 Doctors, Nurses and Respiratory Therapists from the hospital ship Comfort and the Javits Convention Center to hospitals in NYC &amp; State. Have more bed capacity than was needed. Good! Great businessman &amp; philanthropist Bernie Marcus, Co-Founder of Home Depot, said that Congress was too distracted by the (phony) Impeachment Witch Hunt when they should have been investigating  CoronaVirus when it first appeared in China. Media played a big roll also!@dcexaminer If the Fake News Opposition Party is pushing, with all their might, the fact that President Trump \u201cignored early warnings about the threat,\u201d then why did Media &amp; Dems viciously criticize me when I instituted a Travel Ban on China? They said \u201cearly &amp; not necessary.\u201d Corrupt Media! Governors, get your states testing programs &amp; apparatus perfected. Be ready, big things are happening. No excuses! The Federal Government is there to help. We are testing more than any country in the World. Also, gear up with Face Masks! Sorry Fake News, it\u2019s all on tape. I banned China long before people spoke up. Thank you @OANN https://t.co/d40JQkUZg5 The @nytimes story is a Fake, just like the \u201cpaper\u201d itself. I was criticized for moving too fast when I issued the China Ban, long before most others wanted to do so. @SecAzar told me nothing until later, and Peter Navarro memo was same as Ban (see his statements). Fake News! Having been involved in the negotiations, to put it mildly, the number that OPEC+ is looking to cut is 20 Million Barrels a day, not the 10 Million that is generally being reported. If anything near this happens, and the World gets back to business from the Covid 19..... Cuomo\u2019s been calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the state\u2019s responsibility, such as new hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc. I got it all done for him, and everyone else, and now he seems to want Independence! That won\u2019t happen! Crazy Nancy Pelosi deleted this from her Twitter account. She wanted everyone to pack into Chinatown long after I closed the BORDER TO CHINA. Based on her statement, she is responsible for many deaths. She\u2019s an incompetent, third-rate politician! https://t.co/uWNI7DCG3o Why did the W.H.O. Ignore an email from Taiwanese health officials in late December alerting them to the possibility that CoronaVirus could be transmitted between humans? Why did the W.H.O. make several claims about the CoronaVirus that ere either inaccurate or misleading.... ....in January and February, as the Virus spread globally? Why did the W.H.O. wait as long as it did to take decisive action? Lanhee Chen, Hoover Institution Fellow @FoxNews Governor Cuomo should spend more time \u201cdoing\u201d and less time \u201ccomplaining\u201d. Get out there and get the job done. Stop talking! We built you thousands of hospital beds that you didn\u2019t need or use, gave large numbers of Ventilators that you should have had, and helped you with.... ....testing that you should be doing. We have given New York far more money, help and equipment than any other state, by far, &amp; these great men &amp; women who did the job never hear you say thanks. Your numbers are not good. Less talk and more action! China has just announced a doubling in the number of their deaths from the Invisible Enemy. It is far higher than that and far higher than the U.S., not even close! The States have to step up their TESTING! Cuomo ridiculously wanted \u201c40 thousand Ventilators\u201d. We gave him a small fraction of that number, and it was plenty. State should have had them in stockpile! Spending the morning speaking to @fema and Military relative to CoronaVirus. Also, spoke to leaders of various countries including Poland, South Korea and Bahrain. Last night had a very gold conversation with the President of Mexico on numerous topics. Border is very strong! ....Example! V.P. Mike Pence held a conference call yesterday with all Democrat Senators. He gave them everything that they would have wanted to hear in terms of gaining ground on the CoronaVirus, but nothing that anyone could have said, including \u201cit\u2019s over\u201d, could have made.... Just like I was right on Ventilators (our Country is now the \u201cKing of Ventilators\u201d, other countries are calling asking for help-we will!), I am right on testing. Governors must be able to step up and get the job done. We will be with you ALL THE WAY! \u201cOn February 19th there was a Democratic Debate, in Las Vegas. Three words weren\u2019t said: Virus, CoronaVirus, or COVID19. NEVER came up!\u201d @BretBaier Last month all you heard from the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats was, \u201cVentilators, Ventilators, Ventilators.\u201d They screamed it loud &amp; clear, &amp; thought they had us cold, even though it was the State\u2019s task. But everyone got their V\u2019s, with many to spare. Now they scream.... ... \u201cTesting, Testing, Testing,\u201d again playing a very dangerous political game. States, not the Federal Government, should be doing the Testing - But we will work with the Governors and get it done. This is easy compared to the fast production of thousands of complex Ventilators! 96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you! This must also mean that, most importantly, we are doing a good (great) job in the handling of the Pandemic. I urge the Senate and House to pass the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act with additional funding for PPP, Hospitals, and Testing. After I sign this Bill, we will begin discussions on the next Legislative Initiative with fiscal relief.... ....to State/Local Governments for lost revenues from COVID 19, much needed Infrastructure Investments for Bridges, Tunnels, Broadband, Tax Incentives for Restaurants, Entertainment, Sports, and Payroll Tax Cuts to increase Economic Growth. \u201cEconomic impact of Covid-19.\u201d @foxandfriends Very interesting analysis. Light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you! CDC Director was totally misquoted by Fake News @CNN on Covid 19. He will be putting out a statement. .@foxandfriends  We now have many Ventilators to spare. Thank you to all! https://t.co/brNmQKZ1FL Please study this closely. We saved many lives with our fast action on CoronaVirus! https://t.co/IKtkciXEEO Getting VERY good reviews of the job the Federal Government is doing on CoronaVirus. Ventilators, building hospitals, beds and yes, Testing, have been handled incredibly well. Testing is getting exponentially better every day. Love seeing our Country safely opening up! Just spoke to my friend, President Joko Widodo of the Republic of Indonesia. Asking for Ventilators, which we will provide. Great cooperation between us! Just spoke to President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador. Will be helping them with Ventilators, which are desperately needed. They have worked well with us on immigration at the Southern Border! Great conversation with President Lenin Moreno of the Republic of Equador. We will be sending them desperately needed Ventilators, of which we have recently manufactured many, and helping them in other ways. They are fighting hard against CoronaVirus! Just spoke to President Juan Orlando Hernandez of the Republic of Honduras. We work closely together on the Southern Border. Will be helping him with his request for Ventilators and Testing. Great conversation with President Lenin Moreno of the Republic of Ecuador. We will be sending them desperately needed Ventilators, of which we have recently manufactured many, and helping them in other ways. They are fighting hard against CoronaVirus! Thank you to the people of Colorado for the warm and gracious notes and letters sent to me for all of the Ventilators we got for you. It was my great honor! @SenCoryGardner Many testing sites are, and have been, open &amp; available. Just passed 5 Million Tests, far more than any other country in the world. In fact, more than all other major countries combined! Don\u2019t believe the Fake News! https://t.co/uTSMAvj7R3 Just spoke to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali of Ethiopia. His Country needs Ventilators, and the U.S. is in good position to help him. We will! It is a wonderful feeling to know that our States are loaded up with Ventilators, many brand new and high quality just off of our production lines, and that we are now in a position to help other countries that so desperately need them. Every person needing a Ventilator got one! The Do Nothing Democrats are spending much of their money on Fake Ads. I never said that the CoronaVirus is a \u201cHoax\u201d, I said that the Democrats, and the way they lied about it, are a Hoax. Also, it did start with \u201cone person from China\u201d, and then grew, &amp; will be a \u201cMiracle\u201d end! Was just informed that the Fake News from the Thursday White House Press Conference had me speaking &amp; asking questions of Dr. Deborah Birx. Wrong, I was speaking to our Laboratory expert, not Deborah, about sunlight etc. &amp; the CoronaVirus. The Lamestream Media is corrupt &amp; sick! I never said the pandemic was a Hoax! Who would say such a thing? I said that the Do Nothing Democrats, together with their Mainstream Media partners, are the Hoax. They have been called out &amp; embarrassed on this, even admitting they were wrong, but continue to spread the lie! I work from early in the morning until late at night, haven\u2019t left the White House in many months (except to launch Hospital Ship Comfort) in order to take care of Trade Deals, Military Rebuilding etc., and then I read a phony story in the failing @nytimes about my work.... We are doing far more, and better, Testing than any other country in the world, and yet the media does nothing but complain. No matter how good a job is done, the same as with the Ventilators, they will never say we are doing a great job, they will only viciously gripe! Many States moving to SAFELY &amp; QUICKLY reopen! The only reason the U.S. has reported one million cases of CoronaVirus is that our Testing is sooo much better than any other country in the World. Other countries are way behind us in Testing, and therefore show far fewer cases! Cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer was on a late night show using a false talking point over &amp; over again. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough testing ,\u201d he would repeat, when he knows we have done a great job on Testing, just like we have on Ventilators and everything else. He lied, gave NY SALT. Run AOC! Concast (@NBCNews) and Fake News @CNN are going out of their way to say GREAT things about China. They are Chinese puppets who want to do business there. They use USA airwaves to help China. The Enemy of the People! There is tremendous CoronaVirus testing capacity in Washington for the Senators returning to Capital Hill on Monday. Likewise the House, which should return but isn\u2019t because of Crazy Nancy P. The 5 minute Abbott Test will be used. Please inform Dr. Brian P. Monahan. @MarkMeadows The Democrats are just, as always, looking for trouble. They do nothing constructive, even in times of crisis. They don\u2019t want to blame their cash cow, China, for the plague. China is blaming Europe. Dr. Fauci will be testifying before the Senate very soon! #DONOTHINGDEMOCRATS https://t.co/fgHuYeiOQY No reason to turn it down, except politics. We have plenty of testing. Maybe you need a new Doctor over there. Crazy Nancy will use it as an excuse not to show up to work! https://t.co/NucH4dbKBL Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S. Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner... ....Fake News got it wrong again, as always, and tens of thousands of lives were saved by my EARLY BAN of China into our Country. The people that we\u2019re allowed were heavily scrutinized and tested U.S. citizens, and as such, I welcome them with open arms! Getting great reviews, finally, for how well we are handling the pandemic, especially our strong production of desperately needed ventilators, the building of field hospitals &amp; beds, and soon, the great things we are doing on testing. People are really working well together! Mexico is sadly experiencing very big CoronaVirus problems, and now California, get this, doesn\u2019t want people coming over the Southern Border. A Classic! They are sooo lucky that I am their President. Border is very tight and the Wall is rapidly being built! Interesting? By Congress not wanting the special 5 minute testing apparatus, they are saying that they are not \u201cessential\u201d.  In any event, we have great testing capacity, and have performed 6.5 million tests, which is more than every country in the world, combined! MSDNC and FAKE NEWS CNN are going wild trying to protect China! For the constant criticism from the Do Nothing Democrats and their Fake News partners, here is the newest chart on our great testing \u201cmiracle\" compared to other countries. Dems and LameStream Media should be proud of the USA, instead of always ripping us down! https://t.co/8AwnPCNchF Well run States should not be bailing out poorly run States, using CoronaVirus as the excuse! The elimination of Sanctuary Cities, Payroll Taxes, and perhaps Capital Gains Taxes, must be put on the table. Also lawsuit indemnification &amp; business deductions for restaurants &amp; ent. The White House CoronaVirus Task Force, headed by Vice President Mike Pence, has done a fantastic job of bringing together vast highly complex resources that have set a high standard for others to follow in the future. Ventilators, which were few &amp; in bad shape, are now being.... ....produced in the thousands, and we have many to spare. We are helping other countries which are desperate for them. Likewise, after having been left little, we are now doing more testing than all other countries combined, and with superior tests. Face masks &amp; shields,.... ....to it, as appropriate. The Task Force will also be very focused on Vaccines &amp; Therapeutics. Thank you! We are getting great marks for the handling of the CoronaVirus pandemic, especially the very early BAN of people from China, the infectious source, entering the USA. Compare that to the Obama/Sleepy Joe disaster known as H1N1 Swine Flu. Poor marks, bad polls - didn\u2019t have a clue! .@CBS and their show, @60Minutes, are doing everything within their power, which is far less today than it was in the past, to defend China and the horrible Virus pandemic that was inflicted on the USA and the rest of the World. I guess they want to do business in China! Great credit being given for our Coronavirus response, except in the Fake News. They are a disgrace to America! Coronavirus numbers are looking MUCH better, going down almost everywhere. Big progress being made! Asian Americans are VERY angry at what China has done to our Country, and the World. Chinese Americans are the most angry of all. I don\u2019t blame them! Our Testing is the BEST in the World, by FAR! Numbers are coming down in most parts of our Country, which wants to open and get going again. It is happening, safely! Remember this, every Governor who has sky high approval on their handling of the Coronavirus, and I am happy for them all, could in no way have gotten those numbers, or had that success, without me and the Federal Governments help. From Ventilators to Testing, we made it happen! As I have said for a long time, dealing with China is a very expensive thing to do. We just made a great Trade Deal, the ink was barely dry, and the World was hit by the Plague from China. 100 Trade Deals wouldn\u2019t make up the difference - and all those innocent lives lost! Good numbers coming out of States that are opening. America is getting its life back! Vaccine work is looking VERY promising, before end of year. Likewise, other solutions! I am proud to announce that the United States will donate ventilators to our friends in India. We stand with India and @narendramodi during this pandemic. We\u2019re also cooperating on vaccine development. Together we will beat the invisible enemy! Lou, this is just one of numerous concepts being considered under which we would pay 10% of what we have been paying over many years, matching much lower China payments. Have not made final decision. All funds are frozen. Thanks! https://t.co/xQUzHy4NDa We\u2019ve done a GREAT job on Covid response, making all Governors look good, some fantastic (and that\u2019s OK), but the Lamestream Media doesn\u2019t want to go with that narrative, and the Do Nothing Dems talking point is to say only bad about \u201cTrump\u201d. I made everybody look good, but me! Why is it that China, for decades, and with a population much bigger than ours, is paying a tiny fraction of $\u2019s to The World Health Organization, The United Nations and, worst of all, The World Trade Organization, where they are considered a so-called \u201cdeveloping country\u201d and... .....are therefore given massive advantages over The United States, and everyone else? Prior to the Plague floating in from China, our Economy was blowing everybody away, the best of any country, EVER. We will be there again, and soon! Doing REALLY well, medically, on solving the CoronaVirus situation (Plague!). It will happen! The number of Coronavirus cases is strongly trending downward throughout the United States, with few exceptions. Very good news, indeed! REOPEN OUR COUNTRY! Wow! The Front Page @washingtonpost Headline reads, \u201cA BOOST IN TESTS, BUT LACK OF TAKERS.\u201d We have done a great job on Ventilators, Testing, and everything else. Were left little by Obama. Over 11 million tests, and going up fast. More than all countries in the world, combined. \u201cThe Massive Trump Coronavirus Supply Effort that the Media Loves to Hate\u201d @RichLowry https://t.co/VChm4ELmKZ Some wacko in China just released a statement blaming everybody other than China for the Virus which has now killed hundreds of thousands of people. Please explain to this dope that it was the \u201cincompetence of China\u201d, and nothing else, that did this mass Worldwide killing! Spokesman speaks stupidly on behalf of China, trying desperately to deflect the pain and carnage that their country spread throughout the world. Its disinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe is a disgrace.... China is on a massive disinformation campaign because they are desperate to have Sleepy Joe Biden win the presidential race so they can continue to rip-off the United States, as they have done for decades, until I came along! I will be lowering the flags on all Federal Buildings and National Monuments to half-staff over the next three days in memory of the Americans we have lost to the CoronaVirus.... The Wacky Do Nothing Attorney General of Michigan, Dana Nessel, is viciously threatening Ford Motor Company for the fact that I inspected a Ventilator plant without a mask. Not their fault, &amp; I did put on a mask. No wonder many auto companies left Michigan, until I came along! The United States cannot have all Mail In Ballots. It will be the greatest Rigged Election in history. People grab them from mailboxes, print thousands of forgeries and \u201cforce\u201d people to sign. Also, forge names. Some absentee OK, when necessary. Trying to use Covid for this Scam! I give, and have given from the beginning, my entire yearly salary, $400,000 to $450,000, back to our government. Last check to HHS Covid relief. My great honor! https://t.co/Vv6Uyz9MkF Sleepy Joe Biden (mostly his reps.) went crazy when I banned, in late January, people coming in from China. He called me \u201cxenophobic\u201d &amp; then went equally \u201cnuts\u201d when we let in 44,000 people - until he was told they were American citizens coming home. He later apologized! Nobody in 50 years has been WEAKER on China than Sleepy Joe Biden. He was asleep at the wheel. He gave them EVERYTHING they wanted, including rip-off Trade Deals. I am getting it all back! Great reviews on our handling of Covid 19, sometimes referred to as the China Virus. Ventilators, Testing, Medical Supply Distribution, we made a lot of Governors look very good - And got no credit for so doing. Most importantly, we helped a lot of great people! We made most Governors look very good, even great, by getting them the Ventilators, unlimited Testing, and supplies, all of which they should have had in their own stockpiles. So they look great, and I just keep rolling along, doing great things and getting Fake Lamestream News! For all of the political hacks out there, if I hadn\u2019t done my job well, &amp; early, we would have lost 1 1/2 to 2 Million People, as opposed to the 100,000 plus that looks like will be the number. That\u2019s 15 to 20 times more than we will lose. I shut down entry from China very early! ....One person lost to this invisible virus is too much, it should have been stopped at its source, China, but I acted very quickly, and made the right decisions. Many of the current political complainers thought, at the time, that I was moving far to fast, like Crazy Nancy!", "vader_polarity": 0.9999, "analytical": 0.0, "anger": 0.0, "confident": 0.0, "fear": 0.0, "joy": 0.600239, "sadness": 0.514898, "tentative": 0.0}
