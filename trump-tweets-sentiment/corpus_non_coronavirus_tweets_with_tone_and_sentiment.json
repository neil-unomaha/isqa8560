Great! https://t.co/9QByhxRluS Thank you Elise! https://t.co/Y4Hb0zf5jk Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption.

Actually, I couldn\u2019t care less if they negotiate. Will be totally up to them but, no nuclear weapons and \u201cdon\u2019t kill your protesters.\u201d The Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners are working hard to determine whether or not the future attack by terrorist Soleimani was \u201cimminent\u201d or not, &amp; was my team in agreement. The answer to both is a strong YES., but it doesn\u2019t really matter because of his horrible past! Thank you to Rick Scott. This Impeachment Hoax is an outrage! https://t.co/HYfBmtYMqF We are helping Apple all of the time on TRADE and so many other issues, and yet they refuse to unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers  and other violent criminal elements.

Very unfair, but that\u2019s the way the Democrats play the game. Anyway, it\u2019s a lot of fun to watch! The so-called \u201cSupreme Leader\u201d of Iran, who has not been so Supreme lately, had some nasty things to say about the United States and Europe. Their economy is crashing, and their people are suffering. He should be very careful with his words! If you listened to the flawed advice of @paulkrugman at the @nytimes, a newspaper that was going broke until I came along, you would have entirely missed the RECORD BREAKING Stock Market (and other) numbers produced since Election Day, 2016. Sorry, those are the FACTS.... If you listened to the flawed advice of @paulkrugman at the @nytimes, a newspaper that was going broke until I came along, you would have entirely missed the RECORD BREAKING Stock Market (and other) numbers produced since Election Day, 2016.

Oh really?\u201d  @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews  What a disgrace this Impeachment Scam is for our great Country! ...And they say you can add 7% to 10% to all Trump numbers! Who knows? https://t.co/Ta09xrAqUd Nancy can\u2019t fix it. The Do Nothing Dems have done great harm to our Country! https://t.co/qTDgHgIhy1 Will be interviewed at 5:00 A.M.

The fact is, when Mini losses, he will be spending very little of his money on these \u201cclowns\u201d because he will consider himself to be the biggest clown of them all - and he will be right! Interesting poll in Texas-13! #TX13 https://t.co/80uS2VaPGP On my way, see you soon! https://t.co/6Rd5lbafJv Check out @seanhannity now on @FoxNews. Big tonight!

May God be with you all! Schiff must release the IG report, without changes or tampering, which is said to be yet further exoneration of the Impeachment Hoax. He refuses to give it. Does it link him to Whistleblower? Why is he so adamant? Congrats to Christine! https://t.co/BwXISK3oqR Really pathetic how @FoxNews is trying to be so politically correct by loading the airwaves with Democrats like Chris Van Hollen, the no name Senator from Maryland. He has been on forever playing up the Impeachment Hoax. Dems wouldn\u2019t even give Fox their low ratings debates.... If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died to secure\u2014then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020. Only this way, can we save the America we love \u2013 and drain the Washington Swamp once and for all! https://t.co/5NeC0mFWfU No matter how many witnesses you give the Democrats, no matter how much information is given, like the quickly produced Transcripts, it will NEVER be enough for them. They will always scream UNFAIR. The Impeachment Hoax is just another political CON JOB! Thanks to our pro-worker, pro-American economic policies, unemployment is at the lowest level in more than 50 years. We have created over 7 MILLION new JOBS. More Americans are working today than EVER before. We have the hottest ECONOMY on earth! https://t.co/TRGKRF7xgQ For the first time in American History, we have replaced a disastrous Trade Deal that REWARDED outsourcing with a truly FAIR and RECIPROCAL Trade Deal that will keep jobs, wealth and growth right here in AMERICA! https://t.co/bDe8IV9DyD Great photos from a SOUTHERN BORDER WALL Briefing with Secretary of Defense, Mark @EsperDoD! https://t.co/rpGHpdoIa6 This November, we are going to defeat the Radical Socialist Democrats and win the Great State of Iowa in a Historic Landslide! #KAG2020 https://t.co/jYIbSdyGjU THE BEST IS YET TO COME! https://t.co/SOn6wRV9Zs No matter what you give to the Democrats, in the end, they will NEVER be satisfied. In the House, they gave us NOTHING! Many of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg. He is going nowhere, just wasting his money, but he is getting the DNC to rig the election against Crazy Bernie, something they wouldn\u2019t do for @CoryBooker and others. They are doing it to Bernie again, 2016. Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on a great game and a fantastic comeback under immense pressure. We are proud of you and the Great State of Missouri. You are true Champions! Thank you Mike! https://t.co/iNwuaJ3KVP Where\u2019s the Whistleblower? Where\u2019s the second Whistleblower? Where\u2019s the Informer? Why did Corrupt politician Schiff MAKE UP my conversation with the Ukrainian President??? Why didn\u2019t the House do its job? And sooo much more! The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works, just like they ran the Country. Remember the  5 Billion Dollar Obamacare Website, that should have cost 2% of that. The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is \u201cTrump\u201d. Welcome back to Earth, @Astro_Christina, and congratulations on breaking the female record for the longest stay in space! You\u2019re inspiring young women and making the USA proud!

It was an immense honor for me to have presented it to you and the citizens of our very strong and wonderful Country! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and then, KEEP AMERICA GREAT! Because of how badly they did with the Impeachment Hoax, AOC will primary Cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer, and win, and Jerry Nadler has a good chance of losing to his far left primary opponent! It is all getting quite interesting. Pelosi will lose the House, AGAIN! My poll numbers great. Thank you to @mirandadevine of the New York Post for your interesting (and correct) column today. \u201cTrump has gained 20 points since Impeachment began in October. He gets 67% on economy. Nonwhite approval of Trump is also at a high: 28%, up 10 points in a year. Nice one, Nancy.\u201d \u201cA lot of people feel defeated...Trump always wins. It seems like nothing can stop him.\u201d Danny Villazon  @nytimes @DanaPerino @FoxNews  But isn\u2019t that what you want from your President? BEST USA ECONOMY IN HISTORY! Great being in New Hampshire last night. I would say that was the biggest political Rally in New Hampshire history. Incredible evening! Fake News @CNN and MSDNC have not surprisingly refused to talk about my record setting number of voters in New Hampshire (and in Iowa). That\u2019s why they are poorly rated Fake News! I will win both states in November. .@MattForMontana Rosendale is a Strong &amp; Conservative fighter for Montana. Matt stands w/ our Brave Veterans, Loves our Military, and he will continue working to Secure our Border. Matt will NEVER let our #2A go unprotected. Matt has my Total Endorsement! https://t.co/sJqJPVBhVu Mini Mike Bloomberg is a LOSER who has money but can\u2019t debate and has zero presence, you will see. He reminds me of a tiny version of Jeb \u201cLow Energy\u201d Bush, but Jeb has more political skill and has treated the Black community much better than Mini! https://t.co/qIef5VhjDr It is happening again to Crazy Bernie, just like last time, only far more obvious. They are taking the Democrat Nomination away from him, and there\u2019s very little he can do. A Rigged System! .@JodeyArrington from the Great State of Texas has been an incredible supporter of our #MAGA Agenda.

We don\u2019t want to make it impossible to do business with us. That will only mean that orders will go to someplace else. As an example, I want China to buy our jet engines, the best in the World.... ....I have seen some of the regulations being circulated, including those being contemplated by Congress, and they are ridiculous. I want to make it EASY to do business with the United States, not difficult. Everyone in my Administration is being so instructed, with no excuses... Is corrupt Bloomberg News going to say what a pathetic debater Mini Mike is, that he doesn\u2019t respect our great farmers, or that he has violated campaign finance laws at the highest and most sinister level with \u201cpayoffs\u201d all over the place? I am pleased to announce that our highly respected Ambassador to Germany, @RichardGrenell, will become the Acting Director of National Intelligence. Rick has represented our Country exceedingly well and I look forward to working with him. I would like to thank Joe Maguire.... John Kerry and Senator Chris Murphy grossly violated the Logan Act with respect to Iran. If a Republican did what they did, there would be very serious ramifications!

Someday he will be caught, &amp; that will be a very unpleasant experience! Crazy Bernie and the Democrats should see this. I have done far more for the African American community than any President. Secured funding for HBCUs, Criminal Justice Reform, Opportunity Zones, School Choice, Record Low Unemployment, and so much more. THE BEST IS YET TO COME! https://t.co/CcOOsGcdDa No surprise! https://t.co/qCcUPsXgG9 An absolute disgrace! https://t.co/xwmsyitlMh They spied on my campaign! https://t.co/LpIc3cNBnr Word is that Mini Mike Bloomberg performed so poorly in the two debates, that he is thinking about dropping out of the Democrat Primary. The fact is, he was not true to himself, and the public was able to quickly figure him out. Not a good experience for Mini Mike! Mini Mike is getting slammed. His debates were, perhaps, the worst in presidential debating history. A total phony who disavowed \u201cStop &amp; Frisk\u201d after swearing by it for years, and even recently. He horribly overused it, &amp; then dropped when running as a Dem. A total phony! The food is GREAT at Sammy\u2019s Mexican Grill in Phoenix, Arizona. Congratulations to Betty &amp; Jorge Rivas on doing such a wonderful job. I will try hard to stop by the next time I am in Phoenix.

Keep it going! The hard working men and women of @UPS are working overtime to maintain our supply chain and deliver medical supplies to those in need. Your work is critical to the health of our nation, keep it up! This is the way the @nytimes finished a story on me. \u201cYou can see the contrast between the steady, assured, informed and strong leadership that VP Biden (Sleepy Joe) has shown, and the bungling, chaotic and dishonest start-stop approach that Mr. (not Pres.)

They \u201cmaximum\u201d delay even the best candidates, including Judges, leaving little time! I just signed the CARES Act, the single biggest economic relief package in American History \u2013 twice as large as any relief bill ever enacted.
